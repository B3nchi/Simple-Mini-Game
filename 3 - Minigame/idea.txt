you are correct. so here is my idea:
SO, here is my idea. The current code is just a simple zooming galaxy. I have 6 different images:
pants.png
beanie.jpeg
satelite.jpeg
holchi.jpeg
moe.jpeg
ben.gif
stella.png
zach.png

The idea is that at random, objects will be generated. Based on the image selected to be represent these objects, 
they have certain amount of times they need to be clicked. 
pants.jpeg has to be clicked once.
beanie.jpeg has to be clicked once.
satelite.jpeg has to be clicked 5 times.
holchi.jpeg has to be clicked 6 times.
moe.jpeg has to be clicked 7 times. 
ben.gif has to be clicked 10 times. 

There will be an infinite amount of rounds. The first round will start with 4 items generated. 
Each round, there will be a multipler of 2 of items generated.

There is a healthbar at the top left of the screen which shows your health bar and the what current round it is.
The initial state of the healthbar is green and you are at 100 health.
If your health reaches 75, it is yellow. If you reach 35 it is orange. If you reach 15, it is red.
 If you reach 0, then the game will stop and a menu will pop up. This menu will have the following:

"GAME OVER"
"Round Survived: {the amount of rounds survived}"
"Play Again"

If the user clicks play again, everything will reset and the game will restart again.
